# Flutter project template

This project is an opinionated starting point for a Flutter application.

In this project we are using the following tools to set up a solid structure for a Flutter project:

1. [FVM](https://fvm.app) for managing Flutter SDK versions.
2. [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev) for handling mono-repos.
3. [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) for state management.
4. [renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) for keeping dependencies up to date.
5. [ubuntu_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/ubuntu_lints) for linting.
6. [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD.

## Preparations

Before you start working on the project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

### FVM

FVM is a simple version manager for Flutter. It allows you to have multiple Flutter versions installed and switch
between them with ease, which is useful when working on multiple projects that require different Flutter versions.

You will be given the option to do it automatically in a later step, but if you want to do it manually you can install
[fvm](https://fvm.app) globally by following the instructions [here](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation).

You will also need to change your IDE settings to use the Flutter SDK installed by FVM. In Android Studio/Intellij you
can do this by going to `File > Project Structure > Project` and selecting the Flutter SDK installed by FVM in the
`.fvm` directory in your project, and similarly you can do this in VS Code by  pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and selecting
`Flutter: Change SDK`.

### Melos

Melos is a tool for managing Dart and Flutter mono-repos. It allows you to manage multiple packages and apps in a single
repository. This is useful when you have multiple packages that depend on each other, as it allows you to manage them
all in one place. It also allows for running commands across all packages in the mono-repo, versioning them together,
generating changelogs, and more.

You will be given the option to do it automatically in a later step, but if you want to do it manually you can install
[Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev) globally by running:

```bash
flutter pub global activate melos
```

In the GitHub Actions workflow, we are using the [melos-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/melos-action) to
install Melos, run Melos commands and automatically version and publish packages (if they are non-private).

## Getting started

After you have created a new project on GitHub you can use Mason to get started with this template.
[Mason](https://docs.brickhub.dev) is a CLI tool that allows you to create new projects from templates.

You can install it by running:

```bash
flutter pub global activate mason_cli
```

Then you can install the template by running:

```bash
mason add -g ubuntu_flutter_template
```

And to create a new project from the template run:

```bash
mason make ubuntu_flutter_template
```

## Architecture and state management

For state management we use Riverpod with an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) style architecture.

 - Models: Plain immutable Dart classes that represent the data in the app.
 - ViewModels: Classes that contain the business logic of the app. They are responsible for fetching data, transforming
   it, and exposing it to the UI. When using Riverpod the ViewModel is either the `notifier` or the `provider` itself.
 - Views: Widgets that are responsible for rendering the page. They should not contain any business logic.

## Linting

For linting we use the [ubuntu_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/ubuntu_lints) package. This package contains a set of
lint rules that are based on the [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guide and the
[Flutter Style Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/static-analysis/options), it's mostly a superset of the
flutter_lints package.

## License

There are a plethora of licenses used in the Canonical and Ubuntu organizations.
The most commonly used licences are:
 - Apache-2.0 (Apache License 2.0)
 - GPL-3.0 (GNU General Public License 3.0)
 - MIT (MIT License)

The LICENSE file should be placed in the root of the repository and should contain the full text of the license.
If you're unsure which license to use, consult with the project lead, and if there isn't a project lead for the project,
you can go to the [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) website to help you choose a license.

## Issue Templates

Issue template templates can be found under `clipboard_history/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`. When creating a new project,
replace `PROJECT_TODO` with relevent project details.

## Generated files

We never check-in any generated files to the repository. So make sure that your generated files are in the `.gitignore`
file. Instead we generate the files in the CI/CD pipeline and locally when needed.

### Freezed

Since Dart doesn't have any built-in data classes, we use the [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) package to
generate them (when it is needed, you can also create them manually when you know they aren't going to change often).
Freezed is a code generator that makes it easy to work with immutable classes. It generates `copyWith` methods, `==`
and `hashCode` methods, and more for you. It's especially useful when working with Riverpod and immutable classes.

### Translations

If you need translations in your project you can use Weblate. Weblate is a free and open-source web-based translation
management system. It is designed to let contributors help translating your project into multiple languages.

TODO: How to set it up.

## Releasing packages to pub.dev

The first release you make of a package to pub.dev you need to do manually with your own account. After that you should
transfer the package to the Canonical or Ubuntu organization on pub.dev, so that anyone in the organizations can do
releases.

### Automatic releases

For automatic releases we use the [melos-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/melos-action) which makes it
possible to release packages by just pressing a button in the GitHub UI (Actions -> Prepare release -> Run workflow).

To enable automatic releases you have to go to the pub.dev admin page for the package and do the following settings:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fdafb60-2a98-4a59-ab7f-dcd733e4ae74)

Don't forget to press the update button after you have made the changes.

For this to work you should have the following files in your `.github/workflows` directory:

 - `release-prepare.yaml` will open a PR with the changes needed for the release.
 - `release-tag.yaml` will start once the preparation PR is merged and will tag each package that should be released.
 - `release-publish.yaml` will run once for each new tag and do the actual release to pub.dev.

These files are included in the template, so you should not have to do anything to set it up.

## Lockfiles

For applications you should check-in the `pubspec.lock` file to lock the versions of the dependencies. This is to ensure
that everyone working on the project and the CI is using the same versions of the dependencies. For packages you should
not check-in the `pubspec.lock` file since they should be open to using a range of versions in the projects that depend
on the package.
